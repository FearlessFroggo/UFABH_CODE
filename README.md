Features:
Calculation of sequence voltages for each phase
Calculation of sequence currents for each phase
Identification of fault types including balanced, LLL, LL, LLG, and LG faults
Visualization of input voltage and current phasors
Visualization of positive, negative, and zero sequence voltages and currents
Calculation and display of phase angle differences between voltages and currents
This code is a valuable tool for understanding power system protection and fault analysis.
