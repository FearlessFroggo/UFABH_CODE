# FAULT DETECTION USING SEQUENCE COMPONENTS
Maintaining stability and reliable operation of three-phase electrical power systems is crucial for modern infrastructure. Unbalanced conditions arising from faults, unbalanced loads, or harmonics can significantly impact system performance and pose safety risks. Sequence component analysis serves as a powerful tool to diagnose and address these imbalances. We developed a MATLAB code based on the Clarke and Fortescue transformations to calculate the sequence components of phase voltages and currents.

### Features:
Calculation of positive, negative, and zero sequences for voltages and currents

Visualization of phasors using polar plots

Identification of fault type based on sequence component characteristics

Integration with Arduino for hardware

The code was applied to analyze various scenarios, including single-phase, double-phase, and three-phase faults. Results were presented in the form of polar plots showcasing the distinct signatures of each sequence component under specific fault conditions.
