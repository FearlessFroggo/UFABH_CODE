### Features:
Calculation of sequence voltages for each phase

Calculation of sequence currents for each phase

Identification of fault types including balanced, L, LL, LLG, and LG faults

Visualization of input voltage and current phasors

Visualization of positive, negative, and zero sequence voltages and currents

Calculation and display of phase angle differences between voltages and currents

This code is a valuable tool for understanding power system protection and fault analysis.
